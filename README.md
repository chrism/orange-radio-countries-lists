# Orange Radio Continent and Countries lists

This is to track the current lists and the desired final outcomes.

Going to make some notes while I work through them.

- the lists in the API are language dependent, but this isn't reflected currently in the Android application.
  - ie choose language as French
  â€” the continent list and country lists are still listed in English

- ordering... seems weird maybe to do with translations for differences, can we add an index to precise the correct order? (maybe not necessarily exactly alphabetical, like with Antartica, for example) - QUICK FIX - alphabetically

Review of current continents and countries within each continent extracted from the API.

These were generated by the two scripts

`continents-to-csv.rb` and `countries-to-csv.rb`
